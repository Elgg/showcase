# Elgg Showcase
This plugin provides you with a way to let your community show off their work.

For example, in the Elgg Community, this would be used to let people show off the sites they've created with Elgg.

By default, entries in the showcase must be approved by an admin before they are displayed. 
This is so you can maintain some level of quality in what kind of work gets displayed on your site.
The showcase is meant to wow and impress, which won't happen if the high-quality submissions get drowned out by spam.
